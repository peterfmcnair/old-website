# How HTTPS was suprisingly satisfying
I have been trying to get https from my custom domain (petermcnair.blog) as it stands for a while now. I tried adding a CAA certificate with godaddy who are my domain DNS manager which seems to have worked; either that or the addition of AAAA records in the DNS settings.

I just setup namecheap.com for peterfmcnair.com much faster and didn't need to faff with the CAA certificate. It seems like a better choice of domain supplier for these github pages projects. Good to know for next time.

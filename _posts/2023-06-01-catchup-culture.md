# The Catchup Culture
Speaking to a friend from Japan, I became aware of the Aussie "coffee-catchup" culture.
Integral to the maintenance of lasting friendships is an outing to coffee. I don't remember when this entered my repertoire of activities, but it was most likely when I moved to the city.

For a uni student, the catchup culture means everything. It is symbolic of our lifestyle; to drink coffee and muse on the ways of the world with a friend is all any uni student worth their salt wants.

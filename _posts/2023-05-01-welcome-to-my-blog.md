# Introduction
I'm very excited. I tried this setup previously but didn't quite have the patience to get it fully setup. I also hadn't found obsidian, which has been an awesome arrow in my productivity quiver.
# What is my vision for this blog?
I envision this blog as a place for me to formalise my thoughts and hopefully start to publish some critical thinking - in whatever form that takes. It will be a testbench for ideas and a place for me to solidify how I like to write and get feedback too!

For now, I'll just play around with the themes and try to write consistently.

# Jekyll
I'm doing Jekyll serve at the moment and observing how long it takes to update. Wow, it's super quick. I reckon if I just run jekyll serve on my macbook, I should be able to update my website on the fly whenever I make changes to an article on my phone - I may just need a github app on my phone.
Jekyll serve -l for a live reload is also very cool.
# Issues with pages and custom domain
I'm still not fully literate on how to use the custom domains on github pages. I think it's operational though!

This is actually really awesome. I can just push everything to github every time I make a change and it's reflected moments later.

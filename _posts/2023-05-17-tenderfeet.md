# What it feels like to begin
Starting a blog, I am shocked by the sheer number of blogs out there already. I almost feel that I am doing a disservice to the world by adding to the noise; almost.
I discovered [substack](https://substack.com/), which wraps up a paid subscription newsletter style website into a friendly UI. I have no troubles with what they are doing and I think it's a fantastic way to get started, there is just some part of me squirming at the thought.
It's probably just because I realise my own absolute tenderfoot - I can write, but I sure as hell won't get paid for it yet.
# Why bother competing to be heard?
I compare myself to others readily, but why? My psychology allows it I suppose. I want to be heard, but really what I want is to have something to say.
